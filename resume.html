        <div class="about">
            <p>After a decade in healthcare, I've come to know that I am a very empathetic person, 
                but the medical industry tends to exploit that, and I cannot work in a life-or-death industry. 
                But I picked up a lot of skills: team management, non-violent communication, attention to detail, and public speaking.
                <br><br>I am also an artist on the side (MichellesMedicalArt.com, built with Squarespace for e-commerce 
                before I knew the value of webpage speed haha). While I enjoy art, it doesn't pay the bills. 
                If you've got an audience, you can sell almost anything, but if you don't have an audience, well that's 
                marketing - a totally different skill set. <br>
                <br>In my spare time, I'm teaching myself piano, eating leftover vegan takeout, 
                and playing with fractal art on MidJourney.</p>
