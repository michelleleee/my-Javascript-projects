    <h1>Hi there! I'm Michelle, a retired operating room nurse and junior software developer.</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Curious and observant by nature, I’m looking for full-time work in software, specifically seeking guidance and mentorship.</h2>
        <p>My BS is in Nursing but I've taught myself Python, Git, GitHub, JavaScript, 
            The tech industry seems forward thinking by default. Contrasted with medicine, which I've found to be steeped in rigid, hierarchical thinking. I want to contribute to the advancement of humanity, even in "small" ways!

        <h2>I’ve got a BS degree from Rutgers and worked as an operating room nurse/trauma surgery nurse for 8 years. It was a tough job but I learned some key things about myself:
        </h2>
        <p>how to communicate about critical things even to people who are intimidating (like a brain surgeon in the middle of a tricky operation). 
            I worked with a different team of 4-10 people every hour, every day and sometimes there were a lot of strong personalities. 
            I can learn complex technical skills that I don't even particularly like - and still master them and move on. 
            I am a very empathetic person, but the medical industry tends to exploit that, and I cannot work in a life-or-death industry. 
            I value forward-thinking and process improvement. Computers are tools to help humans live better.</p>

        <h3>I am also an artist on the side (MichellesMedicalArt.com, built with Squarespace for e-commerce before I knew the value of webpage speed haha). While I enjoy art, it doesn't pay the bills. If you've got an audience, you can sell almost anything, but it you don't have an audience, well that's marketing - a totally different skill set. </h3>
